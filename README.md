# ðŸ’° Salary Prediction ML Project

Predict the **annual salary of employees** based on their job features using **Machine Learning regression models**. This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment with Streamlit.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict annual salaries of employees using historical data.  
- **Dataset Features:**
  - Gender
  - Years of experience
  - Department
  - Country
  - Center
  - Job Rate
  - Sick Leaves
  - Unpaid Leaves
  - Overtime Hours
- **Target:** `Annual Salary`  

- **Models Used:**
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Decision Tree Regressor
  3. Random Forest Regressor
  4. Gradient Boosting Regressor

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

- **Deployment:** Streamlit app for interactive predictions.

## ðŸ“Š Model Comparison

| Model                  | MAE      | RMSE     | RÂ² Score |
|------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Linear Regression      | ...      | ...      | ...      |
| Decision Tree          | ...      | ...      | ...      |
| Random Forest          | ...      | ...      | ...      |
| Gradient Boosting      | ...      | ...      | ...      |

> The best-performing model is **saved** as `best_salary_model.pkl` for deployment in Streamlit.

## âš¡ How to Run

### 1. Jupyter Notebook
1. Open `Salary_Prediction_Final.ipynb`.  
2. Run all cells to train models, evaluate, and predict new salaries.  
3. The best model will be saved automatically as `best_salary_model.pkl`.

### 2. Streamlit App
1. Install Streamlit if not already installed:
```bash
pip install streamlit
### 2.Run the app:

streamlit run app.py
### 3.Enter employee details and click Predict Salary.
